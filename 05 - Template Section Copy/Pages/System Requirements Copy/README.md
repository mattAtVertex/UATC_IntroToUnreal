# System Requirements Copy

<h2>Hardware Requirements</h2>
<p><em><strong>We strongly recommend that you use a Windows PC to participate in the program</strong></em>. Desktop is typically better than a laptop, but some laptops are powerful enough to get the job done. We suggest at minimum a 2.5ghz quad-core CPU with 16GB of ram and an NVIDIA GPU with 4GB of RAM. A headset with microphone and a broadband internet connection are also required.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you absolutely must use an Apple computer</strong></em>, Vertex will not be able to offer technical support concerning hardware, software, or installation issues. You will need to find your own technical support. If using an Apple Computer, it is advised to not install Windows on your Mac using Bootcamp, but instead use the appropriate Mac versions of software.</p>
