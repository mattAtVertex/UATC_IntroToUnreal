<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Can I work full time while taking this course?</strong></p>
<p>It's not generally recommended, but we understand you have to do what you have to do and it is possible. Some of our best alumni went through the course while working full time. Remember to prioritize doing the work above all else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is time divided?</strong></p>
<p>The bulk of your time should be spent doing the work (the assignments). The training material will show you how to do the work and the group live sessions will be there to motivate you to do the work, but the primary focus will always be the work. Assignments should be completed on time.</p>
<p>Group live sessions are treated like a work day. You should show up on time, be present, and be active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have trouble attending any group live sessions and remember the group live sessions are always recorded for you to watch on your own time if you need.</p>
<p>1:1 mentorship sessions will be in 30 minute blocks. You are expected to be there on time, be active, and respect the times of your fellow classmates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I'm limited on time, how can I still succeed?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our training videos are hosted (unlisted) on YouTube. You can change the playback speed in settings. Watching the training content at 1.5x speed will reduce the time spent watching watching while still being consumable. Remember, the most important thing is doing the work. So you can watch it sped up, take notes, then get in there and just start working on the assignments.</p>
