# The Work vs The Learning Copy

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Work</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our goal is to cultivate a spark in you that leads to an amazing capstone project that might just get you hired. Specifically, we defined our goal as turning you into job candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We define job candidates as people who are able to meet the market needs of the game industry. There are four or five different areas where you have to prove your ability. Those areas are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">High polygon modeling</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Low polygon model</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Texturing and material development</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rendering and presentation</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It is common, for everybody to come into this program and focus on 3-D modeling. This will not work. This will not get you a job in games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What will get you a job is your final, finished render that includes evidence of your high poly, low poly, texture and material development and presentation skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In other words, the final product that you must work to create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In fact, this is the central problem with college and traditional education. The work you produce for traditional education is designed to showcase knowledge not capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Capacity</strong> is what HR departments, hiring managers, and recruiters are actually identifying when they look at your portfolio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Capacity And Knowledge Tracks</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There is a chicken and egg problem here.&nbsp; You may have knowledge of the software, the features and some cool workflows but your execution is not good.&nbsp; In that case, you are not a job candidate.&nbsp; However, if you do NOT have knowledge of a software, feature or workflow then you are can not build capacity, either.&nbsp; So which is necessary?&nbsp; How do you get started?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our program is designed with two tracks in mind. The capacity track and the knowledge track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These tracks work in concert to improve your chances of getting a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Put simply, we want to give you enough knowledge to be dangerous but not so much that you become a monk in cloister and never create something for the real world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Overall, Capacity is our goal but in order to do that we lay a foundation of knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Library And The Arena</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I like to think of these two tracks in terms of a library and then arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Think of an arena. Thereâ€™s a row of gladiators inside waiting their turn. They all come from different parts of the world to take part in this one event. Some have muscles. Some have brains. Your job is to have both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our class sessions will include lectures to introduce you to ideas and concepts and tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our class sessions will include critiques. To build your Capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The knowledge is there to help you but it is not the master. The most important part of these courses is the critique and your work assignment.</span></p>
