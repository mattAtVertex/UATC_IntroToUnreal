# Welcome! Copy

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Welcome</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Welcome to the game arts program. We’re so excited to have you here and what we feel is a very special environment for learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We treat each program like a Boot Camp and one of our guiding principles is that people are&nbsp;<em><strong>over educated and under worked</strong></em>. In essence, we take our educational model from the old atelier in guild systems of the renaissance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We are going to be providing lectures and support material and sharing videos with you. However, at the core of your time here is&nbsp;<strong>The Work</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So we have to talk a little bit about what the work is and what we mean when we say,&nbsp;<strong>The Work</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For most of your education work is defined as your homework. Homework is built around making sure that you understand the concepts that are being taught. That is not what we mean by “the Work quote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Yes, we will be giving you lectures end teaching new concepts. However, we all know artists who have less understanding of software then us but are able to achieve much better results. This is one of the central problems our program was designed to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Personally, I helped develop ZBrush and I knew that software program in and out but I met artist daily that could do more with the clay brush then I could do with all the other features of ZBrush combined.</span></p>
